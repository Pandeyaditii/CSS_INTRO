    <h1>Harry james Potter</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
       Harry is regarded as a fictional icon and has been described by many critics, readers,and audiences as one of the greatest literary and film characters of all time.
       He was portrayed by
       <a href="nowhere">Daniel Radcliffe</a> in all eight Harry Potter films from Philosopher's Stone (2001) to Deathly Hallows – Part 2 (2011).

       <h2>Hermione Jean Granger </h2>
       <hr>

       <p>The character has had immense popularity. The version of Hermione portrayed by Emma Watson in all eight Harry Potter films from Philosopher's Stone in 2001 to Deathly Hallows – Part 2
         in 2011 was voted the best female character of all time in a poll conducted amongst Hollywood professionals by The Hollywood Reporter in 2016.[3]
       </p>

       <h2>Ron Weasley</h2>
       <hr>

       <p>
        Ron is "always there" when Harry needs him. Ron fits many of the stereotypes expected of the sidekick; 
        he is often used as comic relief, is loyal to the hero, and lacks much of the talent Harry possesses, at least, early on, in terms of magical power.
